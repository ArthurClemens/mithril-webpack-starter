# Mithril Webpack Starter

Starter template to scaffold a new [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/) project using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as build tool.

This is an unopinionated template; aside from Mithril and Webpack, the rest of your project's tools are entirely up to you.

## Installation

Pull the template files with [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) and install dependencies.

```
npx degit ArthurClemens/mithril-webpack-starter my-project
cd my-project
npm install
```

## npm scripts

* `npm run dev` - Starts the development server at port 3000
* `npm run build` - Builds the application
* `npm run preview` - Serves the build files locally at port 4000
